Hello, I'm a 37 y.o. developer with 10+ experience in iOS development.

👨‍💻 As an iOS developer, I create intuitive mobile experiences and stay current with iOS development trends while exploring Swift language enhancements.

🌱 In my free time, I enjoy learning about different programming languages and software development concepts to improve my skills.

🐾 When I'm not coding, I enjoy taking care of my pets and spending time with my family. Or at least, that's what I'm supposed to do. In reality, I spend most of my free time tweaking my Neovim configuration. Who needs a social life when you have a perfectly configured Vim editor, right?

🦠 Dipping my toes into vibecoding - trying to catch that flow state without falling completely down the rabbit hole. So far, so good.

💬 Feel free to ask me any questions related to Swift, Objective-C development, Jujutsu version control, or Neovim editor configuration and usage, and I'll be happy to help out.
