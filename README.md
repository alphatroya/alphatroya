Hello, I'm a 36 y.o. developer with experience in iOS and Golang development.

👨‍💻 I'm an iOS developer passionate about creating intuitive and impactful mobile experiences. I'm particularly interested in staying updated on the latest trends in iOS development and exploring improvements in the Swift programming language.

🌱 In my free time, I enjoy learning about different programming languages and software development concepts to improve my skills.

🐾 When I'm not coding, I enjoy taking care of my pets and spending time with my family. Or at least, that's what I'm supposed to do. In reality, I spend most of my free time tweaking my Neovim configuration. Who needs a social life when you have a perfectly configured Vim editor, right?

💬 Feel free to ask me any questions related to Swift, Objective-C, Golang development, or Neovim editor configuration and usage, and I'll be happy to help out.
